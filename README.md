# MonoSIM:Simulating Learning Behaviors of Heterogeneous Point Cloud Object Detectors for Monocular 3D Object Detection

This repository is modified from Garrick Brazil and Xiaoming Liu's [Monocular 3D Region Proposal Network](https://github.com/garrickbrazil/M3D-RPN) based on their ICCV 2019 arXiv report and JuliaChae's [M3D-RPN-Waymo](https://github.com/JuliaChae/M3D-RPN-Waymo) to realize the MonoSIM's function. Please see their project page for more information.
