# MonoSIM:Simulating Learning Behaviors of Heterogeneous Point Cloud Object Detectors for Monocular 3D Object Detection

This repository is modified from Garrick Brazil and Xiaoming Liu's [Monocular 3D Region Proposal Network](https://github.com/garrickbrazil/M3D-RPN) based on their ICCV 2019 arXiv report and JuliaChae's [M3D-RPN-Waymo](https://github.com/JuliaChae/M3D-RPN-Waymo) repository to realize the MonoSIM's function. In addition, we ran the [PV-RCNN](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet)'s code to obtain the necessary data. Please see their project page for more information. 

# Overview

This repository was used to train and evaluate the MonoSIM monocular detector on the the [Waymo Open Dataset](https://waymo.com/open/), the purpose is to research the influence of monocular detector simulating the behaviors of heterogeneous point cloud object detector.
